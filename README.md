# Notion + Things 3

This is a barebones script to add my notion database elements to Things 3

Only runs on macOS. Feel free to add pull requests to make it a more generic API.

### Features

- Adds new database items to Things 3
- Completion sync with Notion
- Non-destructive
  - Tasks unchecked as completed in Things get state restored in Notion
